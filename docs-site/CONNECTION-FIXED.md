# 🔧 Site Connection Fixed!

## ✅ Issue Resolved

The dev server is now running successfully!

## 🌐 **New URL**

Your site is now accessible at:
```
http://localhost:5174/EasyEdit/
```

**Note:** The port changed from **5173** to **5174** because port 5173 was already in use.

## 📊 Server Status

```
✅ Server running: YES
✅ Port: 5174
✅ URL: http://localhost:5174/EasyEdit/
✅ Status: Ready and responding
```

## 🎯 What Happened

Port 5173 was already in use by another process, so Vite automatically found the next available port (5174) and started there instead.

This is normal behavior when:
- Another dev server is running
- A previous process didn't close properly
- Another application is using the port

## 🌐 Access Your Site

**Open in your browser:**
```
http://localhost:5174/EasyEdit/
```

Or use the Simple Browser in VS Code (already opened for you).

## 🔄 If You Want to Use Port 5173

If you prefer to use port 5173, you can:

1. **Kill the process using port 5173:**
   ```bash
   lsof -ti:5173 | xargs kill -9
   ```

2. **Restart the dev server:**
   ```bash
   cd docs-site
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Or specify a specific port:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev -- --port 3000
   ```

## 📝 Quick Commands

```bash
# Check what's on port 5174
lsof -i :5174

# Stop the current server
# Press Ctrl+C in the terminal

# Restart on a different port
npm run dev -- --port 8080
```
